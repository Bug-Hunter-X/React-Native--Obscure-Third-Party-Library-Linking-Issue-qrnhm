To solve this, you should rigorously check the third-party library's documentation for platform-specific installation and linking instructions.  Ensure that you have correctly followed these steps, including any necessary native module setup in both iOS and Android.  Here's a basic example focusing on ensuring the library's native dependencies are correctly included during the build process. This usually involves ensuring correct pod install and gradle setup for iOS and Android respectively. Consider using React Native's autolinking feature if the library supports it, simplifying dependency management.

Example (Illustrative):

// Instead of:
import ImagePicker from 'react-native-image-picker';

// Verify linking and installation then use:
import ImagePicker from 'react-native-image-picker';
// Add error handling:
ImagePicker.launchImageLibrary({}, (response) => {
    if (response.didCancel) {
       console.log('User cancelled image picker');
    } else if (response.error) {
       console.log('ImagePicker Error: ', response.error);
    } else if (response.customButton) {
       console.log('User tapped custom button: ', response.customButton);
    } else {
       console.log('response', JSON.stringify(response));
    }
});
